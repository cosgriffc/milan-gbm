# Building an Illness Severity Score Model with xgBoost
## C.V. Cosgriff, MIT Critical Data

This repository contains the notebook from my demonstration at the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine's Big Datatalk, which ran simulatenously with Milan's first ever datathon. Using severity of illness scores as an example, the notebook walks through extracting data from MIMIC-III, visualizing the extraction, and then training a gradient boosting classification tree model.

Please reach me at cvc@mit.edu with any questions or concerns.
